# Text To Speech
A simple and easy to use text to speech software coded in python using the pyttsx library.
The pre-exisiting voice model is really not that great but after some time I'll try to add in a new voice model.

Installation Guide:
before running the main program please input the following commands:-
1. pip install pyttsx3
2. pip install tkinter
And make sure that you have python insatlled on your device.

#Might not work on android or ios devices- unless you use a linux kernel with GUI capabilites using a ssh sever (p.s. Personally I'd reccomend Andronix for android)
